<b>Basics of the Web</b><br>
<br>



<p>A person will log into a computer and select a browser such as Firefox, Chrome, or IE.  
The browser will be used to navigate around the world wide web/internet.  
The navigation is achieved by placing an <b>HTTP</b> (<em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em> ) request 
via the browser to the servers that contain all of the web data.  The request must be entered
in a language that the computer will understand and that is know as the <b>HTML</b> (<em>Hypertext 
Markup Language</em>).  If the HTML is properly coded, the request will be fulfilled and the recipient
will receive the information back on their computer.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b>HTML</b> is the basis for everything on the web.  It includes the text which is what you see.
The markup drives the format which includes references, images, and links to other pages.
<b>HTML</b> coding is also referred to as elements.  The elements are composed of
opening tags and closing tags with the content between the two tags.  Unless it is a void
tag which does not require a closing tag such as a break or image tag. Tags can be used to make
items bold or italicized.  Also, tags can be used to link to other websites or to add images.
The elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.  Block elements make an invisible box 
around the text.<br>
